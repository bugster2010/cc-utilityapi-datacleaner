Application finds and fixes discrepencies in datetime data exported from UtilityAPI.

## How to Run

- Make sure Python3 is installed
- Double click file
- If did not work, make sure dependencies and packages are installed.

Dependencies:




This assumes that the user has make, python3, and venv already installed on their system. If you don't have make, you can install it using their system package manager (e.g., apt, brew, yum, etc.). The steps for installing python3 and venv depend on a user's operating system.


On other systems, the package name might be different. However, most standard Python installations on Windows and macOS should include tkinter by default.

### If the above doesn't work, manually install packages listed in requirements
